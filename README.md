# Token-Streaming-Protocol
A Clarity smart contract that enables streaming tokens over time, with educational rewards integration for ClarityLearn.

# Token Streaming Protocol - Stacks Ascent Level 1

A production-ready token streaming protocol built on Stacks blockchain, featuring advanced financial controls and educational transparency. Developed as part of the Stacks Ascent program with significant enhancements beyond the base tutorial.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated token streaming protocol that allows users to create time-based payment streams on the Stacks blockchain. Recipients can withdraw funds gradually over time, while senders maintain control over unused funds.

**Built for ClarityLearn Vision:** Enhancing blockchain education through transparent, inspectable smart contracts that demonstrate DeFi mechanics.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Streaming Functionality
- **Stream Creation**: Create payment streams with customizable timeframes and payment rates
- **Time-based Withdrawals**: Recipients can withdraw funds as they become available over time
- **Balance Tracking**: Real-time balance calculations for both senders and recipients

### Advanced Financial Controls
- **Stream Cancellation**: Senders can cancel streams and recover unused funds
- **Stream Refueling**: Extend stream duration by adding additional funds
- **Partial Withdrawals**: Recipients can withdraw specific amounts rather than full balances
- **Automatic Refunds**: Senders can reclaim unused funds after stream completion

### Security & Verification
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: Stream updates verified with secp256k1 signatures
- **Comprehensive Authorization**: Multi-level permission checks for all operations
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation prevents edge cases and user errors

### Educational Features
- **Transparent State**: All contract state is inspectable for learning purposes
- **Clear Error Messages**: Descriptive error codes help users understand failures
- **Documented Logic**: Well-commented code explaining DeFi mechanics

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract (stream.clar)
```clarity
;; Core Functions
- stream-to: Create new payment streams
- withdraw: Extract available funds (partial amounts supported)
- cancel: Terminate streams with refund capability
- balance-of: Check available balances for any party

;; Advanced Functions  
- refuel: Add funds to existing streams
- refund: Reclaim unused funds after completion
- update-details: Modify stream parameters with signature verification

;; Utility Functions
- calculate-block-delta: Time-based calculations
- hash-stream: Cryptographic hashing for signatures
- validate-signature: secp256k1 signature verification
```

### Data Structures
```clarity
;; Stream Storage
streams: {
    sender: principal,
    recipient: principal, 
    balance: uint,
    withdrawn-balance: uint,
    payment-per-block: uint,
    timeframe: {start-block: uint, stop-block: uint}
}

;; Error Codes (8 comprehensive error types)
ERR_UNAUTHORIZED, ERR_INVALID_STREAM_ID, ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT, etc.
```

## üöÄ Development Journey & Challenges

### Challenge 1: Version Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Tutorial code used deprecated `block-height` function not supported in modern Clarity
```clarity
// Deprecated (Tutorial)
block-height

// Modern (My Solution)  
burn-block-height
```
**Solution**: Researched Clarity documentation, identified breaking changes, and systematically updated all deprecated syntax.

**Impact**: Contract now uses current Clarity standards and will remain compatible with future Stacks updates.

### Challenge 2: Clarinet Testing Framework Incompatibility
**Problem**: Clarinet version 3.6.1 lacked `test` subcommand required for automated testing
```bash
clarinet test  # Command not available
```
**Solution**: Implemented hybrid testing approach:
- Used `clarinet console` for manual integration testing
- Maintained vitest test suite for future compatibility
- Documented manual test results for validation

**Impact**: Developed real-world debugging skills and alternative testing strategies.

### Challenge 3: Complex Balance Calculation Logic
**Problem**: Stream balance calculations failed in edge cases (before start, after end, partial withdrawals)
```clarity
// Complex time-based logic with multiple conditions
(define-read-only (calculate-block-delta ...)
```
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive time handling:
- Before stream: Return 0 available balance
- During stream: Calculate proportional balance
- After stream: Cap at total stream duration
- Track withdrawals for partial balance calculations

**Impact**: Robust financial logic that handles all streaming scenarios correctly.

### Challenge 4: Authorization and Security
**Problem**: Needed to ensure only authorized parties could perform stream operations
```clarity
// Multi-level authorization checks
(asserts! (is-eq tx-sender (get sender stream)) ERR_UNAUTHORIZED)
```
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive permission system:
- Sender-only operations (cancel, refuel, refund)
- Recipient-only operations (withdraw)
- Signature-verified operations (updates)

**Impact**: Secure protocol resistant to unauthorized access.

## üîß Technical Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
**Before (Tutorial)**: Basic error responses
**After (My Work)**: 8 descriptive error constants with clear meanings

### 2. Advanced Input Validation
```clarity
// Prevent common user errors
(asserts! (> stop-block start-block) ERR_INVALID_DURATION)
(asserts! (>= initial-balance duration) ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT)
```

### 3. Partial Withdrawal Support
**Before**: Full balance withdrawals only
**After**: Specify exact amounts for better UX

### 4. Cryptographic Integration
**Added**: SHA256 hashing and secp256k1 signature verification for secure stream updates

### 5. Educational Transparency
**Added**: Helper functions for contract state inspection supporting ClarityLearn mission

## üìä Testing & Validation
